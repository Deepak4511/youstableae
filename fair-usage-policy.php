                        <h3>What "Unlimited" means?</h3>
                        <p>In hosting environments, a server's resources are what economists would call a common pool
                            resource, meaning that although having plenty of available system resources benefits
                            everyone, no single user has an incentive to ensure that they don't use too many resources
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Forums and any applications using a commenting system should have some form of spam
                            protection or moderation. CAPTCHA is a popular way to eliminate spam robots from spamming
                            your website.</p>
                        <p>Unlimited Disk Space/Bandwidth/Website Plans. This means that we do not set a limit on the
                            amount of bandwidth, websites or disk space you may use in the normal operation of a
                            personal or small business website, provided it complies with this Agreement. However, in
                            the event your service usage or content presents a risk to the stability, performance or
                            uptime of our servers, data storage, networking or other infrastructure, you may be required
                            to upgrade to a VPS, or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is
                            utilizing.</p>
